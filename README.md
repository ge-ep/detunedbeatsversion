# detunedbeatsversion
<p>The Detuned_Beats_Wash example sketch from the Mozzi library with three pots to adjust randomness of various elements. I used an Arduino Uno as that's what I had on hand. The audio output is on Digital Pin 9, using a cheap LM386 speaker amp and speaker for amplification.</p>
